### FRONTEND

The frontend was built with React. I used Vanilla CSS to to build a responsive website and experience what it's like to not depend on frameworks like Bootstrap or Sass.

### BACKEND

The backend API was built with Ruby on Rails.

### AUTHENTICATION

BCrypt is used to validate passwords and JWT to create and decode tokens. Users must be logged in in order to have access their own planner.  Otherwise, logged out user only have access to recipes.
